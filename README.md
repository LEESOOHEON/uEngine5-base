This project is a base library for uEngine customization applications.

To run a default uEngine5 BPM backend server, build https://github.com/TheOpenCloudEngine/uEngine5-default rather than this.


## Running backend server


```
git clone https://github.com/TheOpenCloudEngine/uEngine5-default.git
cd uEngine5-default
mvn spring-boot:run
```

go to localhost:8080

## Running front-end server

You need a npm installation on your machine

```
cd src/main/resources/dev
npm install
npm run dev
```

go to localhost:8081
